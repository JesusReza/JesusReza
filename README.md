👋 Hi! I'm JesusReza

🎯 I'm a curious person who's always looking for ways to make things more efficient. I love learning, experimenting, and improving little by little every day.

📚 I'm currently an Artificial Intelligence student, focused on understanding how algorithms, machine learning models, and all things AI work.

💡 I'm motivated by the idea of creating smart solutions that can make life easier or make processes faster, simpler, or automated.

🌐 Let's connect
I'm open to connecting, collaborating, or just chatting about AI or tech.
